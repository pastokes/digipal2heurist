<!-- for preparing an XML file 
            with Heurist schema which can be imported into a Heurist database.
            

            The file must indicate a source database in <database id=nnnn>. 
            This is added automatically when HML or this template is exported 
            from a registered Heurist database (it is set to 0 if the 
            database is not registered). 
            

            In the case of data from a non-Heurist source, the file should 
            indicate a database which contains definitions for all the 
            record types and fields to be imported. This can either be 
            the database from which this template is exported or zero or the 
            target database if all the necessary record types and fields 
            exist in the target (either by being imported into it or through
            cloning from a suitable source). If definitions are missing Heurist 
            will update the target database structure from the indicated source
            (if specified). If required definitions cannot be obtained, it will 
            report an error indicating the missing definitions.
            

            Values to be replaced are indicated with ALLCAPS, such as 
            WKT (WellKnownText), NUMERIC, TERM, DATE etc.
            

            RECORD_REFERENCE may be replaced with a numeric or alphanumeric 
            reference to another record, indicated by the <ID> tag. 
            Note that this reference will be replaced with an automatically 
            generated numeric Heurist record ID (H-ID), which will be different 
            from the reference supplied. The reference supplied will be recorded
            in a field Original ID.
            

            If you wish to specify existing Heurist records in the target 
            database as the target (value) of a Record Pointer field, specify 
            their Heurist record ID (H-ID) in the form H-ID-nnnn, where nnnn
            is the H-ID of the target record in the target database. Specifying 
            non-existent record IDs will throw an error. The record type of 
            target records are not checked on import; pointers to records of
            the wrong type can be found later with Verify > Verify integrity. 
            

            In the current version of HML import, you cannot import additional
            data into an existing record (this will be developed later according 
            to demand - in the meantime please use CSV import to update records).
            If you use an H-ID-nnnn format specification in the <id> tag of 
            a record, it will be regarded as an unknown alphanumeric identifier 
            and will simply create a new record with a new H-ID.
            

            <url>URL</url> This record level tag specifies a special URL 
            attached directly to the record which is used to hyperlink 
            record lists and for which checking can be automated. 
            Primarily used for internet bookmarks.  
            

            Specify date field values in ISO format (yyyy or yyyy-mm or yyyy-mm-dd)
            

            termID= specifies any of the following, which are evaluated 
            in order: local ID, concept code, label or standard code.   
            If no match is found, the value will be added as a new term 
            

            Relationship markers: these are indicated by SEE NOTES AT START in 
            the value. Relationship markers are special fields as they contain no data; 
            they are simply a marker in the data structure indicating the display 
            of relationship records which satisfy particular criteria (relationship type 
            and target entity type). They also trigger the creation of relationships 
            with particular parameters during data entry.
            

            Relationships should therefore be imported by importing as records of 
            type RELATIONSHIP. They will appear in the marker fields when the data is 
            viewed. Leave at least one copy of each relationship marker field in the 
            file as this will trigger download of the field definition if it is not in 
            the target database. Only one copy of each relationship marker is needed to 
            trigger the download of the definition, duplicates can be deleted if there 
            is a need to limit file size.
            

            The XML file may (optionally) specify a Heurist database ID 
            with <database id=??>. If a database ID is specified, synchronisation 
            of definitions from that database will be performed before the data 
            are imported. Since imported files will normally use a template for 
            record types and fields exported from the target database, this is 
            only useful for synchronising vocabularies and terms.
